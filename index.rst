Django Treasures
================

I have worked as a Django developer for the last five years and spend a
considerable amount of time digging into the source of Django. Sometimes to
debug errors in my own code, sometimes to figure out how Django implements
a specific feature and sometimes to figure out why Django didn't behave the
way I expected.
Although some of these instances went hand in hand with the feeling of
frustration, I have learned a lot about Django and some of it's awesomeness
that way.

One thing I learned, that I wasn't expecting, was that Django doesn't only
provide the great features that we all know and love, like *models*, *views*,
*forms* and others. No, it also offers a sizable selection of *methods*,
*functions* and *decorators* that solve everyday problems when working
with Python & web applications, and Django in particular.

I wanted to share some of these features with the broader community and started
compiling a list. In 2015, I was lucky enough to be selected as a speaker
at DjangoCon US in Austin, Texas and presented the the list as `Hunting for
Treasures in Django <http://2015.djangocon.us/schedule/presentation/69/>`_.

The idea for this website is to provide a more detailed and more extensive list
of *Django Treasures* with some examples.

This is a work in progress and feedback is very welcome. You can reach out to
me on Twitter `@elbaschid <https://twitter.com/elbaschid>`_ or open a ticket
on the github repo for this site: `django-treasures on github
